Description of the Application Domain
  (1) Best-Play-Option is an application that applies NFL player, game, and team stats to choose the best offensive play against what the other team's defense will most likely be running based on active players and previous games. This application will help coaches choose play options faster and with more confidence. Our research shows no similar applications like this yet, except for possibly another programmer's side project. The program will use player, team, and play-by-play stats as far back as the 2021 NFL season.
  (2) Our data will be pulled from NFL player statistics using Beautiful Soup and free-to-use online datasets. Numerous sources have NFL player statistics, including receiving and rushing yards, blocks, sacks, interceptions, touchdowns, passing yards, play type, result of the play, etc. 

Description of the Functionality
  (1) Basic Functions: CRUD functionality, SQL queries on single tables, SQL queries on multiple tables, Algebraic Analysis.
  (2) Advanced Functions: Play-Predictor, Game-Predictor, Team-Weak-Strong-Pts, Algebraic Analysis. Other than the algebra functions the other functions will utilize Pytorch to predict what the best course of action is across our datasets and options. The platform will create the ability to output a visually insightful look into the play decisions in a live game that can help the coach visualize the plays better.
